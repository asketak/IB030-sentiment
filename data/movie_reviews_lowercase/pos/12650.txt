sonny and my father always said that when i get older i would understand well i finally did i learned something from these two men i learned to give love and get love unconditionally you just have to accept people for what they are and i learned the greatest gift of all the saddest thing in life is wasted talent and the choices that you make will shape your life forever but you can ask anybody from my neighborhood and they'll just tell you this is just another bronx tale
