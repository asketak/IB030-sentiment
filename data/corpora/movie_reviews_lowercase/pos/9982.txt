„i used to worry a lot about who i'd be when i grew up you know like how much money i'd make or umm like some day i'd become some big deal sometimes the thing you want most doesn't happen and sometimes the thing you never expect does like giving up my job in chicago and everything and deciding to stay and apply to med school i don't know you meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you and then you meet one person and your life is changed forever“
