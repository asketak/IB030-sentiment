rooney mara is my favorite living actress blanchett is nonchalant and there's too much buzz around carol for me not to give it a try they are great actresses and perform beautifully in this film cinematography is amazing costumes are amazing and it has strong cinematic moments like the ending so what is it about carol that is so boring well it's a slow-paced story with very little substance and not much really happens after all the films like blue is the warmest color or danish girl it doesn't bring anything new or controversial it's a nice story told with elegance and style it just didn't get deep enough with me
