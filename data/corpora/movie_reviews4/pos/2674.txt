i was ready to hate to say it's just another average superhero movie and well it is but it's different there's more adult content deadpool embodies the teenager's definition of cool it's made for the gag bag-full-of-memes generation self-refrencing and meta it's funny in its unexpected jokes there's not only toilet humor but mostly toilet humor ok a lot of toilet humor but it's still funn! it's like scary movie meets american pie meets spider-man meets any romantic cancer flick the cgi looks good on the big screen slow motion with pop music always works so there's a lot of that it's cinematic i’m about to do to you what limp bizkit did to music in the late ’s quite quotable too
