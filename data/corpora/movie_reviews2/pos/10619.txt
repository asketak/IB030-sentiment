 "We might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us." It's not.. what you thought... When you first... began it. You got... what you want... Now you can hardly stand it, though, By now you know, it's not going to stop... It's not going to stop... It's not going to stop, Till you wise up. ________ You're sure... there's a cure... And you have finally found it. You think... one drink... Will shrink you to... your underground and living down, but it's not going to stop... It's not going to stop... It's not going to stop, Till you wise up. ________ Prepare a list for what you need, Before you sign away the deed, 'Cause it's not going to stop... It's not going to stop... It's not going to stop, Till you wise up. ________ No, it's not going to stop, Till you wise up. No, it's not going to stop, So just give up.
