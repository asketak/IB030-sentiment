I was ready to hate, to say it's just another average superhero movie, and well it is, but it's different, there's more adult content, deadpool embodies the teenager's definition of cool, it's made for the 9gag bag-full-of-memes generation, self-refrencing and meta, it's funny in its unexpected jokes, there's not only toilet humor, but mostly toilet humor, ok a lot of toilet humor, but it's still funn! it's like Scary Movie meets American Pie meets Spider-Man meets any romantic cancer flick, the CGI looks good on the big screen, slow motion with pop music always works so there's a lot of that, it's cinematic. "I’m about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late ’90s" quite quotable too.
